## Client-Server Network
A basic example of a TCP client/server network using Python's socket and threading library. The server uses instances of a client object and individual threads to listen to incoming data from each client while listening for new connections.

To install the necessary requirements run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start the server:
```
server.py
```

To start the client:
```
client.py
```
